They alone have parental responsibility for you and not Social Services.  Care Order- Young people are sometimes on a care order, which is made by a court (a family not criminal court). The court will make a care order where there are worries that a young person is being harmed or is at risk of significant harm. Both Social Services and your parents have to work together to make decisions about your life (they share parental responsibility for you). If you are on a temporary care order this is called a 'Interim' Care Order.Special Guardianship Order (SGO) - An order means a child lives with carers who have parental responsibly for them and usually lasts until a child is 18. The child is no longer the responsibility of the Local Authority. Parental Responsibility - Those with parental responsibility for you have the right to make decisions about the way you are brought up, if you are on a Care Order. Social Services will share parental responsibility with your parent(s).
