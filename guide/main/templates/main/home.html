                <li>What is being in care?</li>
                <li>Who can I talk to about problems I'm having?</li>

                    <h2>What is being in care?</h2>
                    <p>Children and young people who are unable to live at home sometimes have to live with a foster family.
                        Foster care is when children and young people live with and are cared for by people who are not
                        their parents.</p>
                    <p>Foster carers have been specially trained to look after you and keep you safe.
                        Fostering families come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes you might live with a family member
                        like a grandparent or an aunt or uncle or a friend who is a foster carer and this is called ‘Kinship’
                        foster care.</p>
                    <p>There are different types of foster care and this can be short-term or long term,
                        depending on your circumstance and your needs. You might stay with your foster family for a short
                        time, maybe for a few weeks or a few months or you may need a permanent home with your foster
                        family as you are unable to return to your birth family.</p>
                    <p>Your social worker will talk to you about your plan. Social workers will work with your parents
                        and foster carers to make decisions about what happens to you. They should remember your wishes
                        and feelings when making decisions about you.</p>

                    <h2>Your rights</h2>
                    <p>All children and young people have rights. These rights are what the government says you are entitled to,
                        to make sure you’re treated fairly and that you receive a good standard of care.</p>

                    <h2>Will I see my friends?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your social worker and foster family should support you so that you can keep in touch with your
                        friends from school, if you move away and are not able to see them anymore.
