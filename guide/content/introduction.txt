Children and young people who are unable to live at home sometimes have to live with a foster family.
Foster care is when children and young people live with and are cared for by people who are not
their parents. Foster carers have been specially trained to look after you and keep you safe.
Fostering families come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes you might live with a family member
like a grandparent or an aunt or uncle or a friend who is a foster carer and this is called ‘Kinship’
foster care.There are different types of foster care and this can be short-term or long term,
depending on your circumstance and your needs. You might stay with your foster family for a short
time, maybe for a few weeks or a few months or you may need a permanent home with your foster
family as you are unable to return to your birth family. Your social worker will talk to you about
your plan. Social workers will work with your parents and foster carers to make decisions about
what happens to you.
They should remember your wishes and feelings when making decisions about you.
